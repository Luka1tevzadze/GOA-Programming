this was the best day of my life. of entering GOA Academy. i have been intrested in programming when i was only 8!

as an junior into coding. im really happy coding on my 1st day. usually i would have used ChatGPT. but i have done it alone without any help from an ai.

im really proud of myself and i hope to have an successful life and retire young. im really happy i joined GOA Academy

my mindset is for becoming an chad and earning a lot of money.. also becoming an cybersecurity expert
